      <h3>Gene editing</h3>
      <p>

Different sequences within our DNA dictate different characteristics; however, sometimes there are mistakes in DNA-mutations in genes that can cause many different kinds of serious diseases.
 Our DNA is at the root of each of us - that unique combination of genes that makes us all individuals.
  Familiar examples of genetically defined diseases include cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.
   The idea of solving the human organ shortage with pigs has tantalized surgeons for decades.. More than 117,000 Americans are currently on a transplant wait-list in the U.S.,
   according to federal figures, and 22 people die every day awaiting a match.. There Are Four Different Types Of Nucleotide Possible In A Dna Sequence: Adenine, Cytosine,
   Guanine And Thymine Symbolized With A, C, G And T. The Order Of These Nucleic Acids Form The Genetic Code.. Genome editing is a way of making specific
   changes to the DNA of a cell or organism.. An enzyme cuts the DNA at a specific sequence, and when this is repaired by the cell a change or -edit- is made to the sequence..
